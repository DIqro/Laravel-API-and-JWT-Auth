# Laravel-API-and-JWT-Auth
Make API with laravel, not just send data but using authentication system with Json Web Token

# Set Up Project
1. Set your database in .env file.
2. For instant import table in database, you can use migrate.

# Library JWT
In this case, I use library from https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth
